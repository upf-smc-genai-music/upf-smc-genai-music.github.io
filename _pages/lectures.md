The videos are a "review" of the fundamentals of Transformers - You've looked at Transformers before, I know, but they are here because you may not have all the details clear in your mind and they are excellent (Bloem for clear explanation, and 3 Brown one Blue for visualization).

The paper is a classic. It is actually Text-2-Audio, but uses a token-based autoregressive Transformer network at its core, using language as conditioning. Pretty cool, and a good transition to more "proper" text to audio that we will look at next week.
