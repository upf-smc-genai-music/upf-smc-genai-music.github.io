## Assignments Submission



The data repository should include (where appropriate) :

* A REAMDE.md describing the project.
* A `requirements.txt` file listing all Python dependencies, if needed, ensuring they can be easily installed.
* **Python 3.10** code (a notebook is fine) for demonstrating the project goals if appropriate.

## Assignment 1: Texture Dataset curation

Here we will create a set of wav files of a sound "texture" that varies systematically in some dimension (Recall the water dataset "fill level"). The dataset should be 10-15 minutes of audio roughly equally distributed over the various parameter values. The data can all be in .wav (or other audio formats, see below) file (with varying parameter) or in multiple audio files. 

​	If you are generating the sounds synthetically/algorithmically, you can generate these .csv files at the same time. If you are recording, plan ahead so that the parameter files don't have to be created by hand - they can be created by processing the file (extracting the parameter, for example), or can be recorded so that the parameter values linearly from beginning to end, or is constant for the duration of the corresponding wave file,  so that the parameter file is easy to generate. 

​	In addition to the pairs of data files, there needs to be a single parameters.json file describing the parameter (see below). The complete dataset specification follows (although if you don't have different classes, and only use a single parameter of variation, it does not have to be as compex)



## **1. Required Data**

The dataset requires three types of data: **audio files**, **annotations**, and **parameter specifications**. Each one is explained below. (No installation of python code necessary!)

### **1.1 🎵 Audio Files**

Most audio file formats and sampling rates are supported, although the final model will always operate at 24kHz.

**Supported Audio Formats**: `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.flac`, `.aac`, `.ogg`, `.m4a`, `.wma`, `.aiff`, `.au`, `.ra`, `.3gp`, `.amr`, `.ac3`, `.dts`, `.ape`, `.mka`, `.opus`

### **1.2 📊 Annotations (CSV Files)**

Each audio file **must** have a corresponding CSV file with the **exact same base name**:

| Audio File  | CSV File                | Status                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `piano.wav` | `piano.csv`             | ✅ Correct                    |
| `flute.mp3` | `flute_annotations.csv` | ⛔ Incorrect - name mismatch! |

The CSV annotation files must follow this specific structure:

- **Header row** with parameter names (must match those in `parameters.json`)
- **One row per frame** (75 frames per second)
- **Continuous parameters**: Numeric values (will be normalized to [0,1] range)
- **Categorical parameters**: Non-negative integers representing each class (0, 1, 2, ...)

Example CSV:

| saturation | reverb | instrument |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------- |
| 10.5       | 40.3   | 0          |
| 10.0       | 40.32  | 1          |
| 9.8        | 40.25  | 0          |
| ...        | ...    | ...        |

### **1.3 ⚙️ Parameter Specifications**

Information about the parameters to be controlled must be stored in a `parameters.json` file. Each parameter must specify its **name** and **type** (either `continuous` or `class`). Additional features will depepnd on the type of the parameter as follow:

**🔢 Continuous Parameters** (numeric values like tempo, volume, saturation):

- `min`/`max`: Range used for normalization
- `unit`: Physical unit (e.g., bpm, %, dB)

**🏷️ Class Parameters** (categorical values like instrument type, genre):

- `classes`: Ordered list of class names (order determines integer mapping)

#### Example `parameters.json`:

```json
{
    "parameter_1": {"name": "saturation", "type": "continuous", "unit": "dB", "min": 0,   "max": 12}, 
    "parameter_2": {"name": "reverb",     "type": "continuous", "unit": "%",  "min": 0,   "max": 100},
    "parameter_3": {"name": "instrument", "type": "class",      "classes": ["piano", "flute"]}
}
```

## **📁 2. Required File Structure**

Before running this notebook on your data, make sure it is structured as follows:

**Option 1:** Simple Structure (all data together)

```
dataset_folder/
└── raw/                         # Raw input data
    ├── parameters.json          # Parameter configuration file
    ├── piano.wav                # Audio files (various formats supported)
    ├── piano.csv                # Corresponding CSV annotations
    ├── flute.mp3                # More audio files...
    ├── flute.csv                # More CSV files...
    └── ...
```

**Option 2:** Split Structure (separate train/validation/test sets) If you want to use specific data splits for training, validation, and testing.

```
dataset_folder/
└── raw/                         # Raw input data
    ├── parameters.json          # Parameter configuration file
    ├── train/
    │   ├── piano.wav            # Training audio files
    │   ├── piano.csv            # Training CSV annotations
    │   └── ...
    ├── validation/
    │   ├── flute.mp3            # Validation audio files
    │   ├── flute.csv            # Validation CSV files
    │   └── ...
    └── test/
        ├── violin.mp3           # Test audio files
        ├── violin.csv           # Test CSV files
        └── ...
```



#### 3. Other considerations

Sound textures can be recorded or generated using any appropriate technology. Some ideas:

​	Machine sound at different speeds (preferably continuous over a range), pitched sounds (preferably continuous!), cards shuffling, spinning coins (with a parameter that goes from 0 to 1 over ), room hum, crowd "hubbub", boiling water. Chat can generate tons of "texture+parameter" ideas to help you! 

​	Textures with a single varying parameter may be difficult to find, easier to make, maybe even easier to create synthetically. Maybe some of your projects form part I of the course can generate something we could consider a "texture"?  You might also consider text-to-audio systems. 

​	***Watch out for "unwanted" variation that won't sound consistent during conditional generation!***



* OPTIONAL  : The dataset format description should be adequate for this homework. But, if you want to see how a dataset works in RNeNcodec,  you can download the "quickstart"  (watterfill) example (see the README) for that repository. (You could even trying prepping, training, and playing!)

### Deadlines

* The assignment is due by **February 23rd** before class on GitHub Classroom (**you may work in pairs**)
* Your dataset should be sharable for others in the class and for demoing.
* Invitation to create github classroom repository: https://classroom.github.com/a/XX7s3JdO
