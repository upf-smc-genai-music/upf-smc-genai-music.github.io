### Tools and Programming Languages

Part 1 of the course will use Python. All coding assignments should be coded in Python 3.10. The deep learning implementation will be done in TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch. 

### Tasks
#### Pre-class quizzes
Students will be required to submit a quiz on the current technology before each class. The quizzes will test their understanding of the concepts discussed in the assigned pre-class videos. There will be two quizzes, covering **Genetic Algorithms** and **Transformers**.

#### Coding Assignments
There will be two coding assignments—one for each technique introduced in the course. Coding assignments will be done in groups of **three** or **four** people.

#### Final Project

The Final Project for Part 1 will focus on symbolic generative music.

The task will be to design and implement a symbolic generative music system. This project should demonstrate the adaptation and/or combination of one or more techniques covered during the course.

The Final Project will be done in groups of three or four people – **the same who worked on the coding assignments together**.

#### Deliverables
The deliverable for the code assignments and Final Project is a repository with the implementation code in the course GitHub Classroom. 

### Deadlines
The pre-class quizzes would be open as follows:
* *Genetic Algorithms quiz*: January 12th noon - January 13th noon
* *Transformer quiz*: January 25th noon - January 26th noon
* The two **code assignments** are due by February 15th at midnight

**The final project is due by February 16th at midnight**


### Evaluation
Evaluation for the *Generative Algorithms for Sound and Music* course will be as follows:
* Part 1 (Valerio): 50% of the overall score
* Part 2 (Lonce): 50% of the overall score

#### Part 1 Evaluation
* Pre-class Quizzes: 10% of Part 1 score (two quizzes, each contributing equally).
* Coding Assignments: 40% of Part 1 score
* Final Project: 50% of Part 1 score

#### Coding Assignments + Final Project Evaluation (Part 1)
Final Project and Coding Assignments will be graded on a scale of 1 to 10 based on the following criteria:
1. Soundness of the implementation
2. Cleanliness of the implementation (i.e., [clean code](https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29))
3. Clarity of the presentation
4. Quality of the creative output

### Office Hours

Students can book 15-minute slots (individually or in groups) with Valerio Velardo via this [Calendly page](https://cal.com/valerio-velardo-c9eoxh/office-hours-with-valerio), from 18:30–19:30 every Wednesday from January 14th until February 18th

Students can reserve time with Fernando and Andreas (TAs) through MTG Slack.

### Communication

For general questions, please use the dedicated Slack channel on the MTG workspace: **#smc25-musicgen**. This channel will serve as a hub for asynchronous communication and updates for all students, so make sure to check it regularly. 

For individual questions, doubts, or ideas, feel free to send a direct message to Valerio Velardo, Fernando, and Andreas  in the MTG Slack (@Valerio Velardo, @AndreasP, @Fernando).
